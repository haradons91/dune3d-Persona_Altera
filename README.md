# Dune3D Persona Altera

**This is not the Dune 3D project.** It is a personal, heavily modified
derivative of it, developed for one person's own use.

## What this is

Dune3D Persona Altera started as a fork of [Dune 3D](https://github.com/dune3d/dune3d),
the open-source parametric 3D CAD application created by
[carrotIndustries](https://github.com/carrotIndustries). Since forking it, this
project has diverged substantially in both code and direction, through an
extended series of AI-assisted development sessions (using Claude/Claude
Code) directed by its owner. Large parts of the codebase have been rewritten,
replaced, or added outright by that process, well beyond what would normally
be called a "patch" or "contribution."

Some of what's changed relative to upstream Dune 3D:

 - A different UI: a ribbon-style toolbar, document tabs, and a group
   timeline strip replacing the original menu/toolbar layout.
 - A component/occurrence system for nesting and instancing sub-assemblies.
 - Mesh import (STL, 3MF) and mesh-to-body conversion (sewing a triangle
   mesh into a solid, with multiple algorithms and a cancellable progress
   dialog).
 - Support for building against newer OpenCASCADE releases (8.0.1), plus a
   number of rendering/performance fixes uncovered along the way.
 - Various workflow and interaction changes (snapping, drag-and-drop of
   sketches/bodies between components, live cut previews while extruding,
   and more) that reflect this fork owner's own preferences rather than
   upstream's.

Because of that divergence, this repository should be treated as its own
thing, not as a lightly-patched copy of Dune 3D, and not as a place to look
for what upstream Dune 3D currently does or intends.

## AI-assisted development and no upstream contribution

This project is openly built with AI assistance as a matter of course, not
as an occasional aid. Treat any given file, commit, or feature here as
likely to have been written or substantially modified by an AI acting under
this fork owner's direction, rather than hand-written line by line.

This fork exists purely for its owner's own use and experimentation. It is
**not** intended to be upstreamed, merged, or otherwise contributed back to
the original Dune 3D project, and it is not intended to be a source of
contributions to any other project either. If you're comparing this against
upstream Dune 3D's own contribution policy: that policy is about *their*
project, not this one, and nothing here is headed in that direction.

## License

Like upstream Dune 3D, this project is licensed under the GNU General
Public License v3.0 -- see [LICENSE](LICENSE). All credit for the original
design and the vast majority of the pre-fork codebase belongs to
[carrotIndustries](https://github.com/carrotIndustries) and the Dune 3D
contributors; see the [upstream project](https://github.com/dune3d/dune3d)
for that history.

## How to build

The general build process still follows upstream Dune 3D's own
[build instructions](https://docs.dune3d.org/en/latest/build-linux.html)
(CMake/meson, OpenCASCADE, gtkmm4). This fork additionally supports building
against OpenCASCADE 8.0.1 built from source; see `meson.build` for the
relevant linker flags if you're doing that.

## Questions

This is a personal fork with no separate community, discussion board, or
support channel of its own. For general questions about Dune 3D itself (not
this fork's own changes), upstream's
[documentation](https://docs.dune3d.org/), [matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#dune3d:selfnet.de)
and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dune3d/dune3d/discussions) are
the right place to ask -- they are upstream's channels, not this fork's.
